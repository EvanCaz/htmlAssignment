        <h1> Evan's Random thoughts</h1>
        <p> 
            the great thing about <b>me</b> is i am tall. I watched the Reacher TV show which starred Alan Richardson<br>
            and one day I will be as yoked as him. I hit my <i><b><u>curvy</u></b></i> water bottle on my hand and it made a fun 
            <br> noise and now I cannot stop. At the time of writing this, I have consumed two core power strawberry protein <br>
            shakes because of the booth on campus, both of which were very good. <br> 
        </p>
